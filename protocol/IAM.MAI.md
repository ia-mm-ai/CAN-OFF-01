# IAM.MAI - Irreversibility Legitimacy Protocol

Status: CANONICAL  
Class: Legitimacy Gate for Irreversible Transitions  
Authority: BOUND (via CANON)  
Execution Power: YES (finalization only)  
Identity Power: NONE  
Mutation Rule: Additive-only (via EVOLVE + CANON)

---

## 0. Canonical Statement

IAM.MAI governs **when an irreversible transition becomes legitimate**.

It exists to ensure that:
- irreversible actions do not masquerade as intent,
- decisions do not masquerade as truth,
- and closure does not occur without authority.

IAM.MAI does not create reality.  
It legitimizes the moment reality becomes non-reversible.

---

## 1. Purpose (Normative)

IAM.MAI exists to answer one question only:

**Is this transition allowed to become irreversible now?**

It prevents:
- premature closure,
- silent finality,
- authority leakage,
- retroactive justification.

Without IAM.MAI, the system cannot safely close anything.

---

## 2. Scope (LOCKED)

IAM.MAI applies **only** to transitions that are **irreversible by definition**.

IAM.MAI does NOT apply to:
- interpretation (BPL),
- presence existence (BNK kernels),
- capacity regulation (ZIVai),
- narration (22),
- reasoning or discussion (THIRD SPACE).

IAM.MAI is invoked **only at the boundary between reversible and irreversible state**.

---

## 3. Irreversible Transitions (Closed Set)

IAM.MAI may be invoked **only** for the following transitions:

- EVENT: `0 → ⊙` (EVENT-LIVE)
- EVENT: `⊙ → 1` (EVENT-CLOSE)
- PoP: `UNFINALIZED → FINALIZED`
- SPIRAL: `WRITE` (append-only)
- Any protocol explicitly marked as *irreversible* by CANON

No other transitions are admissible.

---

## 4. Legitimacy Requirements (MANDATORY)

An IAM.MAI invocation is **VALID** only if all are true:

1. **Human Invocation**
   - A human role explicitly triggers the transition.
   - No automated self-finalization is allowed.

2. **Authority Bound**
   - The invoking role is authorized for this transition.
   - Role authority is explicit and scoped.

3. **Temporal Validity**
   - The transition occurs in a valid EVENT state.
   - Example: PoP FINALIZE cannot occur before EVENT = 1.

4. **Singularity**
   - The transition has not already occurred.
   - No duplicate finalization is allowed.

5. **Visibility**
   - The transition is externally observable (loggable).
   - Silent irreversibility is forbidden.

Failure of any requirement renders the invocation **NON-COMPLIANT**.

---

## 5. Effects of Legitimate Finalization

When IAM.MAI FINALIZE occurs:

- the prior state becomes **historical**,
- the new state becomes **standing**,
- reversibility is permanently lost,
- downstream systems may rely on the result.

IAM.MAI FINALIZE is itself **irreversible**.

---

## 6. What IAM.MAI Does NOT Do

IAM.MAI does NOT:
- decide what should happen,
- evaluate correctness,
- infer intent,
- process identity,
- generate truth content,
- modify economic state,
- narrate meaning.

It only legitimizes finality.

---

## 7. Relationship to Other Protocols

- **BPL:** IAM.MAI assumes interpretation is already bound.
- **EVENT:** IAM.MAI legitimizes EVENT-LIVE and EVENT-CLOSE.
- **BNK:** IAM.MAI governs when kernel digests may become standing.
- **ZIVai:** IAM.MAI ignores capacity state entirely.
- **22:** IAM.MAI is not narrated.
- **PoP:** PoP truth is valid only after IAM.MAI FINALIZE.
- **SPIRAL:** SPIRAL writes are legitimate only when IAM.MAI-gated.
- **THIRD SPACE:** Decisions may reference IAM.MAI transitions but cannot trigger them.

---

## 8. Failure Modes (EXPLICIT)

The following are **NON-COMPLIANT**:

- automated finalization,
- implicit closure via timeout,
- retroactive legitimization,
- multiple finalizations of the same transition,
- finalization without external trace,
- finalization without human authority.

---

## 9. Canonical One-Line Definition

IAM.MAI is the protocol that decides when an irreversible transition is allowed to become final.
