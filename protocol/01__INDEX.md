# Protocol Index - The Presence Stack

Protocol-ID: P.01.INDEX  
Filename: 01__INDEX.md  
Status: CANONICAL  
Mutation: EVOLVE ONLY  
Authority: BOUND BY CANON

---

This document is the **authoritative index and glossary** for all protocols in The Presence Stack.

It defines:
- protocol names,
- their class and scope,
- one-line canonical meaning,
- and how they relate without collapsing authority.

No protocol listed here may claim power outside its declared scope.

---

## I. Foundational Envelope

### CANON
**Class:** Constitutional Law  
**Role:** Defines non-negotiable invariants governing the entire system.

> CANON is the frozen constitutional layer that binds all protocols and forbids silent authority, drift, or retroactive truth.

---

### KENTRA KERNEL
**Class:** Integrity & Continuity Kernel (L0.5)  
**Role:** Enforces admissibility, boundaries, and continuity across all layers.

> KENTRA KERNEL conditions whether any state, transition, or signal is allowed to exist, without deciding outcomes or creating truth.

---

### PROPORTION
**Class:** Continuity Constraint / System Envelope  
**Role:** Gates all motion so continuity is preserved.

> PROPORTION constrains admissibility of motion across the stack, without executing actions, creating truth, or inferring identity.

---

## II. Pre-Cognitive Admission

### BPL - Binding Precondition Layer
**Class:** Admissibility Gate  
**Role:** Determines whether reasoning may begin.

> BPL prevents cognition from occurring on malformed, inadmissible, or incoherent inputs.

---

## III. Temporal & Structural Reality

### EVENT - Temporal Container
**Class:** Reality Container  
**Role:** Defines when reality may exist.

> EVENT is the temporal container that admits reality exactly once (EVENT = ⊙) and dissolves all non-final state at closure.

**States:**  
- `0` Not Live  
- `⊙` Live  
- `1` Closed  

---

### Live-Hold (Composite State)
**Class:** Structural Allowance (Composite)  
**Defined As:**  
EVENT.state = ⊙
AND
MOTION.state = HOLD
> **Live-Hold is the state in which reality is permitted to exist without being forced into decision, and presence is honored without being converted into truth.**

Live-Hold is **not** a protocol.  
It is a **canonical composite state** arising from EVENT + MOTION.

---

## IV. Live Presence & Capacity

### BNK - Bracelet n-Kernel Protocol
**Class:** Presence Custody (Event-Scoped)  
**Role:** Hosts presence ephemerally during EVENT ⊙.

> BNK allows presence to exist during an event without becoming identity, memory, or truth, and guarantees dissolution at EVENT closure.

---

### ZIVai - Field Capacity Regulation
**Class:** Capacity & Saturation Signal  
**Role:** Signals how much additional change a live field can absorb.

> ZIVai is the live-field regulator that signals capacity within Live-Hold, without creating authority, legitimacy, or truth.

ZIVai:
- operates only while EVENT = ⊙,
- exists only within Live-Hold,
- never blocks or decides.

---

### 22 - Field Narration
**Class:** Aggregate Narration Layer  
**Role:** Makes live state legible without power.

> 22 narrates aggregate field state during EVENT ⊙ without instruction, persistence, authority, or identity.

---

## V. Evidence & Truth

### KAPIA - Threshold Crossing Evidence
**Class:** Irreversible Threshold Evidence  
**Role:** Records that a boundary was crossed.

> KAPIA records irreversible crossings as evidence only, never as truth or authority.

---

### PoP - Proof of Presence
**Class:** Truth Instantiation  
**Role:** Converts presence into immutable truth after EVENT closure.

> PoP is the only protocol that creates presence truth, post-EVENT, via human attestation and IAM.MAI legitimacy.

---

### SPIRAL - Immutable History
**Class:** Append-Only Truth Ledger  
**Role:** Records finalized truth and transitions.

> SPIRAL records immutable history exactly as it was finalized, and never otherwise.

---

## VI. Governance & Action

### THIRD SPACE
**Class:** Decision Trace (Reversible)  
**Role:** Records decisions without allowing them to become truth.

> THIRD SPACE records decisions made in response to truth, without allowing those decisions to become truth themselves.

---

### IAM.MAI - Irreversibility Legitimacy
**Class:** Finality Gate  
**Role:** Legitimize irreversible transitions only.

> IAM.MAI decides when an irreversible transition is allowed to become final, without collapsing temporal allowance into decision or presence into truth.

IAM.MAI governs:
- EVENT-LIVE
- EVENT-CLOSE
- PoP FINALIZE
- SPIRAL APPEND
- irreversible execution classes

---

### UPAD - Unified Action Dispatch
**Class:** Decision → Execution Request Boundary  
**Role:** Creates non-binding execution requests.

> UPAD converts decisions into scoped execution requests without authority, identity, or execution power.

---

### ISPAD - Irreversible & Safety-Scoped Dispatch
**Class:** Execution Legitimacy & Audit  
**Role:** Authorizes and audits external execution.

> ISPAD legitimizes and records execution under PROPORTION and IAM.MAI constraints, without creating truth.

---

## VII. Structural Relationships (Non-Collapsible)

- **EVENT governs when reality exists.**
- **MOTION governs how interaction proceeds.**
- **Live-Hold allows reality without decision.**
- **ZIVai signals capacity, never legitimacy.**
- **IAM.MAI legitimizes irreversibility only.**
- **PoP creates truth only after EVENT closure.**
- **SPIRAL records only finalized truth.**
- **THIRD SPACE records decisions, never truth.**
- **UPAD requests execution; ISPAD authorizes it.**

No protocol may collapse these roles.

---

## VIII. Failure Modes (Global)

The following are NON-COMPLIANT across the lattice:

- treating capacity as authority,
- forcing resolution because EVENT is live,
- creating truth during EVENT ⊙,
- persisting presence beyond EVENT closure,
- collapsing decision into execution,
- collapsing narration into governance,
- inferring identity anywhere in the stack,
- retroactively legitimizing irreversibility.

---

## IX. Canonical One-Line Summary

**The Presence Stack is a constitutional system that allows reality to exist without forcing decision, legitimizes irreversibility explicitly, creates truth only once, and dissolves everything else.**
