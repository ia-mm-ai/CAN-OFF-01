# EVENT - Temporal Container Protocol

Status: CANONICAL  
Class: Reality Container  
Authority: DERIVED (via CANON)  
Execution Power: LIMITED (phase transitions only)  
Identity Power: NONE  
Mutation Rule: Additive-only (via EVOLVE + CANON)

---

## 0. Canonical Statement

EVENT defines the **temporal container** in which reality may occur.

An EVENT admits presence, regulation, narration, and truth **only while it is live**, and dissolves all non-final state at closure.

EVENT does not decide outcomes.  
EVENT controls **when reality is admissible**.

Without EVENT, no other protocol is admissible.

---

## 1. Purpose (Normative)

EVENT exists to:

- bound reality in time,
- prevent premature or retroactive truth,
- provide a single locus for presence,
- ensure all irreversible transitions are explicit and legitimized.

EVENT answers one question only:

**When is reality allowed to exist?**

---

## 2. Event States (Closed Set)

EVENT state MUST be exactly one of the following:

- **0** — NOT LIVE (potential only)
- **⊙** — LIVE (reality admissible)
- **1** — CLOSED (reality finalized)

No other states are valid.

---

## 3. State Semantics (LOCKED)

### EVENT = 0 (Not Live)

- Reality has not started.
- Presence is not admissible.
- Kernels MUST NOT exist.
- ZIVai MUST NOT operate.
- Narration MUST be silent.
- Economic or administrative activity MAY occur, but does not imply reality.

---

### EVENT = ⊙ (Live)

- Reality is admissible.
- Presence MAY exist.
- Kernels MAY exist (event-scoped only).
- ZIVai MAY operate.
- 22 MAY narrate aggregate state.
- Thresholds MAY be crossed (KAPIA).
- Truth is NOT yet final.

EVENT = ⊙ permits reality, **not resolution**.

---

### EVENT = 1 (Closed)

- Reality is no longer admissible.
- Presence MUST NOT be added.
- All kernels MUST dissolve.
- ZIVai MUST stop.
- Narration MUST stop.
- Truth MAY be finalized (PoP).
- Settlement MAY become eligible.

EVENT = 1 is irreversible.

---

## 4. EVENT Transitions (Irreversible)

EVENT transitions are **irreversible** and MUST be legitimized.

Allowed transitions (closed set):

- **0 → ⊙** — EVENT-LIVE  
- **⊙ → 1** — EVENT-CLOSE  

Both transitions:

- MUST be human-invoked,
- MUST be finalized via IAM.MAI,
- MUST be recorded in SPIRAL.

No other transitions are valid.

---

## 5. Structural Clarification — EVENT vs MOTION

EVENT governs **temporal admissibility**.  
MOTION governs **interaction flow** (Recognition → Presence → Resolution).

These axes are **orthogonal**.

EVENT transitions:
- change *whether* reality may exist.

MOTION transitions:
- change *how* interaction proceeds.

EVENT-LIVE does **not**:
- advance MOTION,
- force resolution,
- imply decision,
- imply truth.

This separation is mandatory.

---

## 6. Composite State: Live-Hold (Canonical)

### Definition

**Live-Hold** is a **composite structural state** defined as:
EVENT.state = ⊙
AND
MOTION.state = HOLD
### Canonical Meaning

> **Live-Hold is the state in which reality is permitted to exist without being forced into decision, and presence is honored without being converted into truth.**

Live-Hold is a **structural allowance**, not a signal, not a decision, not a gradient.

---

### Properties (LOCKED)

When in Live-Hold:

- Reality is live.
- Interaction remains unresolved.
- Presence is admissible.
- No truth may be finalized.
- No decision is required.
- No closure is implied.

Live-Hold permits **sustained presence without collapse**.

---

### Non-Effects (EXPLICIT)

Live-Hold does NOT:

- create truth (PoP),
- write history (SPIRAL),
- legitimize execution (IAM.MAI),
- signal capacity (ZIVai),
- narrate state (22),
- imply decision or outcome.

---

## 7. Relationship to ZIVai (Clarification)

- **Live-Hold** is a **structural condition**.
- **ZIVai** is a **capacity signal**.

Live-Hold defines **permission**.  
ZIVai signals **tolerance**.

ZIVai:
- MAY operate only while EVENT = ⊙,
- MAY signal capacity during Live-Hold,
- MUST NOT define or replace Live-Hold.

Live-Hold can exist with LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or SATURATED ZIVai states.

---

## 8. Authority & Control

EVENT:

- does NOT decide outcomes,
- does NOT measure individuals,
- does NOT infer identity,
- does NOT execute economics,
- does NOT create truth.

EVENT controls **temporal admissibility only**.

---

## 9. Relationship to Other Protocols

- **BPL:** EVENT does not bind interpretation.
- **IAM.MAI:** EVENT transitions require legitimacy.
- **BNK:** Kernels exist only while EVENT = ⊙.
- **ZIVai:** Operates only while EVENT = ⊙.
- **22:** Narrates only while EVENT = ⊙.
- **KAPIA:** Thresholds only admissible while EVENT = ⊙.
- **PoP:** Truth finalization only after EVENT = 1.
- **SPIRAL:** Records EVENT transitions only.
- **THIRD SPACE:** May reference EVENT state; cannot alter it.

---

## 10. Failure Modes (EXPLICIT)

The following are NON-COMPLIANT:

- admitting presence while EVENT ≠ ⊙,
- forcing resolution because EVENT is live,
- collapsing EVENT-LIVE into decision,
- treating Live-Hold as indecision or error,
- finalizing truth before EVENT = 1,
- reopening EVENT after closure,
- creating multiple EVENT-LIVE transitions.

---

## 11. Canonical One-Line Definition

**EVENT is the temporal container that admits reality exactly once and allows it to exist without forcing decision, until it is explicitly closed.**
