# SPIRAL - Immutable History Protocol

Protocol-ID: P.12.SPIRAL  
Filename: 12__SPIRAL.md  
Status: CANONICAL  
Class: Append-Only Memory & Lineage  
Mutation: EVOLVE ONLY

---

## 0. Canonical Statement

SPIRAL governs **how truth becomes immutable history**.

It defines a single append-only record of finalized facts and legitimized transitions, preserving lineage without allowing rewrite, deletion, or retroactive interpretation.

SPIRAL does not decide truth.  
SPIRAL records it.

---

## 1. Purpose (Normative)

SPIRAL exists to answer one question only:

**What has irreversibly happened?**

It prevents:
- history being rewritten,
- truth being corrected post hoc,
- decisions masquerading as facts,
- narrative replacing record.

---

## 2. Scope (LOCKED)

SPIRAL applies **only to finalized outcomes**.

SPIRAL does NOT apply to:
- interpretation (BPL),
- live presence (BNK),
- threshold evidence (KAPIA),
- capacity signals (ZIVai),
- narration (22),
- provisional decisions (THIRD SPACE).

SPIRAL is **post-fact only**.

---

## 3. Append-Only Model (LOCKED)

SPIRAL is strictly append-only.

Allowed operations:
- APPEND

Forbidden operations:
- UPDATE
- DELETE
- OVERWRITE
- REORDER
- REDACT

Any non-append operation is **NON-COMPLIANT**.

---

## 4. Admissible Entries (Closed Set)

SPIRAL MAY contain only records that are:
- explicitly finalized,
- IAM.MAI-legitimized,
- event-scoped.

Admissible record types include:
- EVENT-LIVE
- EVENT-CLOSE
- PoP FINALIZE
- IAM.MAI FINALIZE
- KERNEL_DIGEST (optional)
- EVOLVE lineage records

No other entries are valid.

---

## 5. Record Properties (MANDATORY)

Every SPIRAL record MUST:

- be immutable once written,
- reference its triggering event,
- reference its legitimizing IAM.MAI transition,
- carry a timestamp,
- be opaque with respect to identity.

SPIRAL records MUST NOT:
- encode identity,
- encode intent,
- encode narrative,
- encode economic meaning.

---

## 6. Lineage & Evolution

SPIRAL supports **lineage**, not mutation.

Lineage rules:
- new records MAY reference prior records,
- references establish ancestry, not correction,
- EVOLVE produces successor records, not edits.

History grows forward only.

---

## 7. Authority & Power

SPIRAL:
- does NOT evaluate correctness,
- does NOT infer meaning,
- does NOT execute decisions,
- does NOT trigger protocols.

SPIRAL is **memory, not mind**.

---

## 8. Relationship to Other Protocols

- **EVENT:** SPIRAL records EVENT transitions.
- **IAM.MAI:** SPIRAL entries are valid only if IAM.MAI-legitimized.
- **PoP:** PoP truth becomes immutable only when written to SPIRAL.
- **BNK:** Kernel digests MAY be recorded; kernels never are.
- **ZIVai:** ZIVai state is never recorded.
- **22:** Narration is never recorded.
- **THIRD SPACE:** Decisions may reference SPIRAL; SPIRAL never references decisions.

---

## 9. Failure Modes (EXPLICIT)

The following are **NON-COMPLIANT**:

- writing provisional or reversible state,
- modifying or deleting records,
- encoding identity,
- recording live kernel state,
- allowing narrative annotations,
- allowing economic data to imply truth.

---

## 10. Canonical One-Line Definition

SPIRAL is the protocol that records immutable history exactly as it was finalized, and never otherwise.
