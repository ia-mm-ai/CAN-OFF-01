# 22 - Field Narration Protocol

Status: CANONICAL  
Class: Narration / Legibility Layer  
Authority: DERIVED (via EVENT + CANON)  
Execution Power: NONE  
Truth Power: NONE  
Identity Power: NONE  
Mutation Rule: Additive-only (via EVOLVE + CANON)

---

## 0. Canonical Statement

22 governs **how a live EVENT becomes legible without becoming governed**.

It narrates aggregate field state so participants may orient themselves, without measuring individuals, issuing instructions, or creating authority.

22 does not act.  
22 does not decide.  
22 does not persist.

---

## 1. Purpose (Normative)

22 exists to answer one question only:

**What is the collective state right now?**

It prevents:
- opacity during live reality,
- authority emerging from silence,
- participants inferring rules from absence,
- control masquerading as communication.

Narration replaces guessing, not governance.

---

## 2. Scope (LOCKED)

22 applies **only while** `EVENT.state = ⊙`.

22 does NOT apply to:
- interpretation binding (BPL),
- temporal admissibility (EVENT),
- legitimacy of finality (IAM.MAI),
- presence custody (BNK),
- threshold evidence (KAPIA),
- capacity regulation (ZIVai),
- truth instantiation (PoP),
- immutable history (SPIRAL),
- decision recording (THIRD SPACE).

22 is **live-state only**.

---

## 3. Inputs (Permitted)

22 MAY consume **already-computed aggregate signals** from other protocols, including:

- **ZIVai capacity state** ∈ {LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, SATURATED}
- EVENT phase markers (LIVE, CLOSURE APPROACHING)
- coarse timing cues (start, nearing end)

22 MUST NOT compute these inputs itself.

---

## 4. Outputs (Closed Set)

22 MAY emit narrative cues such as:

- current capacity band (verbatim, unmodified),
- phase transitions,
- collective rhythm or pacing signals.

Outputs MUST be:
- one-to-many,
- non-interactive,
- non-targeted,
- non-instructional.

Format is implementation-defined (audio, text, ambient), but semantics are fixed.

---

## 5. Authority & Power (LOCKED)

22:
- does NOT instruct actions,
- does NOT recommend decisions,
- does NOT enforce pacing,
- does NOT block access,
- does NOT alter capacity,
- does NOT create truth.

Narration has **zero authority**.

---

## 6. Persistence Rules

22 MUST NOT:
- store logs,
- record history,
- write SPIRAL,
- write THIRD SPACE.

All narration is **ephemeral**.

---

## 7. Identity Posture (LOCKED)

Identity exists externally and is out-of-scope.

22 MUST NOT:
- ingest identity,
- infer identity,
- address individuals,
- segment audiences.

All narration is aggregate-only.

---

## 8. Relationship to Other Protocols

- **EVENT:** 22 exists only while EVENT is live (⊙).
- **ZIVai:** 22 MAY narrate ZIVai output verbatim.
- **BNK:** 22 never references kernels.
- **KAPIA:** 22 has no gating power.
- **PoP:** 22 does not imply truth.
- **SPIRAL:** 22 writes nothing.
- **THIRD SPACE:** 22 may be referenced but never legitimizes decisions.

---

## 9. Failure Modes (EXPLICIT)

The following are **NON-COMPLIANT**:

- targeted or personalized narration,
- instructional or directive messaging,
- persistence of narration or logs,
- identity-derived cues,
- modification of ZIVai semantics,
- narration outside EVENT ⊙.

---

## 10. Canonical One-Line Definition

22 is the live narration layer that makes collective state legible during an event, without authority, persistence, or identity processing.
