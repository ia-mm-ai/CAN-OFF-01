# IAM.MAI - Irreversibility Legitimacy Protocol

Protocol-ID: P.06.IAM_MAI  
Filename: 06__IAM_MAI.md  
Status: CANONICAL  
Class: Legitimacy Gate for Irreversible Transitions  
Mutation: EVOLVE ONLY

---

## 0. Canonical Statement

IAM.MAI governs **when an irreversible transition is allowed to become final**.

It exists to ensure that:
- irreversibility does not masquerade as intent,
- closure does not occur silently or prematurely,
- and reality is not retroactively legitimized.

IAM.MAI does not create reality.  
IAM.MAI legitimizes **irreversibility**.

---

## 1. Purpose (Normative)

IAM.MAI exists to answer one question only:

**Is this transition allowed to become irreversible now?**

It prevents:
- silent finality,
- premature closure,
- authority leakage,
- narrative being mistaken for legitimacy,
- and resolution being forced where only allowance is intended.

---

## 2. Scope (LOCKED)

IAM.MAI applies **only** to transitions that are **irreversible by definition**.

IAM.MAI does NOT apply to:
- interpretation (BPL),
- live presence custody (BNK),
- capacity signaling (ZIVai),
- narration (22),
- reasoning or deliberation (THIRD SPACE),
- reversible interaction flow (MOTION).

IAM.MAI is invoked **only at irreversibility boundaries**.

---

## 3. Irreversible Transition Classes (Closed Set)

IAM.MAI may be invoked **only** for the following transition classes:

### A. Temporal Irreversibility (EVENT)

- **EVENT-LIVE**: `EVENT 0 → ⊙`
- **EVENT-CLOSE**: `EVENT ⊙ → 1`

These transitions govern **temporal admissibility of reality**.

They do **not**:
- resolve interaction,
- decide outcomes,
- create truth,
- or imply motion finality.

---

### B. Truth Irreversibility

- **PoP FINALIZE**: provisional → truth
- **SPIRAL APPEND**: mutable → immutable history

These transitions create **standing truth**.

---

### C. Execution Irreversibility

- External actions whose effects cannot be undone
- Actions explicitly marked irreversible by CANON

Execution irreversibility is **never implied** and always requires explicit legitimacy.

---

No other transitions are valid.

---

## 4. Structural Clarification — EVENT vs MOTION

IAM.MAI distinguishes **two orthogonal axes**:

### EVENT (Temporal)
- Governs **whether reality is admissible**
- Controlled by EVENT-LIVE / EVENT-CLOSE
- Irreversible
- Legitimated by IAM.MAI

### MOTION (Interaction)
- Governs **how interaction proceeds**
- States include: IDLE → RECOGNITION → HOLD → RESOLUTION
- Reversible until explicitly finalized
- **Not governed by IAM.MAI unless an irreversible outcome is requested**

IAM.MAI **must not** collapse these axes.

---

## 5. Live-Hold Alignment (Canonical)

When the system is in:
EVENT = ⊙
AND
MOTION = HOLD
the system is in **Live-Hold**.

### IAM.MAI Semantics in Live-Hold

- IAM.MAI **may be invoked** to legitimize:
  - EVENT-LIVE (already occurred),
  - EVENT-CLOSE (future),
  - or other irreversible transitions.

- IAM.MAI **must not** be used to:
  - force MOTION resolution,
  - collapse HOLD,
  - imply decision,
  - or convert presence into truth.

Live-Hold is a **structural allowance**, not a pending failure.

---

## 6. Legitimacy Requirements (MANDATORY)

An IAM.MAI invocation is **VALID** only if **all** are true:

1. **Human Invocation**
   - A human role explicitly triggers the transition.
   - No automated self-finalization is allowed.

2. **Authority Bound**
   - The invoking role is authorized for the specific transition.
   - Authority is role-scoped, not identity-scoped.

3. **Temporal Validity**
   - The transition occurs in a valid EVENT state.
   - Example: PoP FINALIZE requires `EVENT = 1`.

4. **Singularity**
   - The transition has not already occurred.
   - Duplicate finalization is forbidden.

5. **Visibility**
   - The invocation is externally observable and loggable.
   - Silent irreversibility is NON-COMPLIANT.

Failure of any requirement renders the invocation invalid.

---

## 7. Effects of Legitimate Finalization

When IAM.MAI FINALIZE occurs:

- the prior state becomes **historical**,
- the new state becomes **standing**,
- reversibility is permanently lost,
- downstream systems may rely on the result.

IAM.MAI FINALIZE is itself **irreversible**.

---

## 8. What IAM.MAI Does NOT Do

IAM.MAI does NOT:
- decide what should happen,
- evaluate correctness,
- infer intent,
- process identity,
- generate narrative meaning,
- regulate capacity,
- resolve interaction by default.

IAM.MAI legitimizes **finality**, not **direction**.

---

## 9. Relationship to Other Protocols

- **CANON:** IAM.MAI authority is bounded and derived.
- **EVENT:** IAM.MAI legitimizes EVENT-LIVE and EVENT-CLOSE.
- **Live-Hold:** IAM.MAI respects Live-Hold and must not collapse it.
- **BNK:** IAM.MAI governs only kernel-derived irreversibility, never kernel existence.
- **ZIVai:** IAM.MAI ignores capacity signals entirely.
- **22:** IAM.MAI is not narrated.
- **PoP:** PoP truth requires IAM.MAI FINALIZE.
- **SPIRAL:** SPIRAL writes are valid only when IAM.MAI-legitimized.
- **THIRD SPACE:** Decisions may reference IAM.MAI transitions but cannot trigger them.

---

## 10. Failure Modes (EXPLICIT)

The following are **NON-COMPLIANT**:

- using IAM.MAI to force decision,
- collapsing EVENT-LIVE into motion resolution,
- finalizing truth during EVENT ⊙,
- automated or implicit finalization,
- retroactive legitimization,
- multiple finalizations of the same transition,
- invoking IAM.MAI without visible trace.

---

## 11. Canonical One-Line Definition

**IAM.MAI is the protocol that decides when an irreversible transition is allowed to become final, without collapsing temporal allowance into decision or presence into truth.**
