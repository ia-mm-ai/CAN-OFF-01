# ZIVai - Field Capacity Regulation Protocol

Status: CANONICAL  
Class: Field Capacity & Saturation Regulator  
Authority: DERIVED (via EVENT + CANON)  
Execution Power: NONE  
Identity Power: NONE  
Mutation Rule: Additive-only (via EVOLVE + CANON)

---

## 0. Canonical Statement

ZIVai governs **how much additional change a live EVENT can absorb without collapse**.

It observes aggregate field motion during EVENT ⊙ and emits a capacity state that informs pacing and orientation, without measuring individuals, creating truth, or executing decisions.

ZIVai does not act.  
ZIVai signals.

---

## 1. Purpose (Normative)

ZIVai exists to answer one question only:

**How much additional motion can this field safely absorb right now?**

It prevents:
- overload being discovered only after failure,
- silent saturation,
- capacity being inferred from narrative or intent.

ZIVai regulates **field tolerance**, not behavior.

---

## 2. Scope (LOCKED)

ZIVai applies **only while** `EVENT.state = ⊙`.

ZIVai does NOT apply to:
- interpretation (BPL),
- legitimacy of irreversibility (IAM.MAI),
- presence custody (BNK),
- threshold evidence (KAPIA),
- truth instantiation (PoP),
- immutable history (SPIRAL),
- decision making (THIRD SPACE),
- narration (22).

ZIVai is **live-field only**.

---

## 3. Field-Level Operation (LOCKED)

ZIVai operates strictly at the **aggregate field level**.

ZIVai MUST NOT:
- inspect individuals,
- maintain per-kernel state,
- derive or infer identity,
- track behavior over time.

ZIVai observes **change**, not entities.

---

## 4. Inputs (Permitted)

ZIVai MAY observe the following **event-scoped, aggregate-only signals**:

- Δ(t): magnitude of change in field activity over time
- ΔΔ(t): acceleration of change (optional)
- variance / entropy of aggregate deltas
- anomaly density (e.g., rejection rates, pacing events)
- stability across rolling time windows

All inputs MUST be:
- non-identitarian,
- ephemeral,
- event-scoped.

---

## 5. Output (Closed Set)

ZIVai MUST emit **exactly one capacity state** at any observation point:
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
SATURATED

Semantic meaning (non-binding):
- **LOW:** ample capacity remaining
- **MEDIUM:** normal operating envelope
- **HIGH:** nearing saturation
- **SATURATED:** no additional admissible change without degradation

ZIVai MUST NOT:
- emit numeric scores,
- rank entities,
- predict outcomes,
- suggest actions.

---

## 6. Effect of ZIVai Output

ZIVai output MAY be consumed by:
- admission pacing logic,
- surface throttling,
- narration layers (22).

ZIVai output MUST NOT:
- block access,
- override IAM.MAI,
- alter KAPIA semantics,
- affect PoP truth,
- write to SPIRAL.

ZIVai informs **capacity**, not **legitimacy**.

---

## 7. Authority & Power

ZIVai:
- does NOT execute actions,
- does NOT decide outcomes,
- does NOT enforce limits,
- does NOT create truth,
- does NOT persist state.

ZIVai has **zero authority**.

---

## 8. Relationship to Other Protocols

- **EVENT:** ZIVai exists only while EVENT is live (⊙).
- **BNK:** ZIVai MAY observe aggregated kernel deltas; never individual kernels.
- **KAPIA:** ZIVai MAY inform pacing; does not permit or deny crossings.
- **PoP:** ZIVai has no role in truth creation.
- **SPIRAL:** ZIVai writes nothing.
- **22:** ZIVai output MAY be narrated verbatim.
- **THIRD SPACE:** ZIVai may be referenced but never drives decisions.

---

## 9. Failure Modes (EXPLICIT)

The following are **NON-COMPLIANT**:

- persisting ZIVai state beyond EVENT ⊙,
- emitting per-person or per-kernel outputs,
- treating ZIVai output as authority or truth,
- using identity-derived inputs,
- allowing ZIVai to execute or enforce actions.

---

## 10. Canonical One-Line Definition

ZIVai is the live-field regulator that signals how much additional change an event can absorb, without measuring individuals, persisting state, or creating authority.
