# Protocol Index (CANON Map)

Status: **CANONICAL**  
Class: **Index / Navigation**  
Authority: **BOUND (via CANON)**  
Mutation Rule: **Additive-only (via EVOLVE + CANON)**

This index is the canonical map of the protocol stack.  
It does not override any protocol. It only links and locates.

---

## Constitutional layer

- **CANON.md** — Constitutional specification (binding law)  
  - File: `CANON.md`

---

## Pre-cognitive admissibility

- **BPL — Binding Precondition Layer**  
  Reasoning is permitted only when input is admissible.  
  - File: `BPL.md`

---

## Temporal container

- **EVENT — Temporal Container Protocol**  
  Defines when reality is admissible (0 / ⊙ / 1).  
  - File: `EVENT.md` *(if EVENT is currently embedded elsewhere, extract it here when ready)*

---

## Live presence layer (EVENT = ⊙)

- **BNK — Bracelet–NFT–Kernel Protocol**  
  Presence custody during live events without identity, memory, or truth.  
  - File: `BNK.md`

- **ZIVai — Field Capacity Regulation Protocol**  
  Aggregate-only capacity state: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / SATURATED.  
  - File: `ZIVai.md`

- **22 — Field Narration Protocol**  
  Aggregate narration only; no authority, no persistence.  
  - File: `22.md`

- **KAPIA — Threshold Crossing Protocol**  
  Irreversible crossings recorded as evidence, not truth.  
  - File: `KAPIA.md`

---

## Truth + immutable history

- **PoP — Proof of Presence Protocol**  
  Converts human-attested presence into truth only after EVENT closure and IAM.MAI.  
  - File: `PoP.md`

- **SPIRAL — Immutable History Protocol**  
  Append-only history of finalized transitions and truths.  
  - File: `SPIRAL.md`

---

## Governance + execution boundary

- **THIRD SPACE — Decision Trace Protocol**  
  Decisions exist without becoming truth.  
  - File: `THIRD-SPACE.md`

- **UPAD — Unified Action Dispatch Protocol**  
  Decision → non-binding execution request (no authority, no identity).  
  - File: `UPAD.md`

- **ISPAD — Execution Legitimacy + Audit Protocol**  
  Authorizes + audits execution without producing truth.  
  - File: `ISPAD.md`

- **IAM.MAI — Irreversibility Legitimacy Protocol**  
  Human-invoked legitimacy gate for irreversible transitions.  
  - File: `IAM.MAI.md`

---

## System envelope

- **PROPORTION — Continuity Constraint Protocol**  
  Wraps the entire stack and blocks drift across time.  
  - File: `PROPORTION.md`

---

## Integrity kernel (L0.5)

- **KENTRA — Integrity & Continuity Kernel**  
  System-wide admissibility, continuity, and boundary enforcement.  
  - File: `KENTRA.md`
