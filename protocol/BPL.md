# BPL - Binding Precondition Layer

Status: CANONICAL  
Class: Interpretive Precondition  
Authority: NONE  
Execution Power: NONE  
Truth Power: NONE  
Mutation Rule: Additive-only (via EVOLVE + CANON)

## 0. Canonical Statement

BPL governs **whether reasoning is allowed to occur at all**.

It binds interpretation *before* cognition, inference, governance, or execution, and halts the system when inputs are malformed, ambiguous, or semantically overloaded.

If BPL fails, **no reasoning may proceed**.

---

## 1. Purpose (Normative)

BPL exists to answer one question only:

**Is this input admissible for reasoning?**

It prevents:
- reasoning on ambiguous inputs,
- intent being inferred from language,
- authority being smuggled through phrasing,
- meaning collapsing before constraints are known.

BPL does not decide *what to think*.  
It decides *whether thinking is permitted*.

---

## 2. Scope (LOCKED)

BPL applies to **all inputs that may trigger reasoning**.

This includes:
- human language,
- agent prompts,
- protocol invocations,
- governance inputs,
- system-to-system messages.

BPL does NOT apply to:
- finalized truth (SPIRAL),
- immutable records,
- post-fact narration (22).

BPL is **pre-cognitive**.

---

## 3. Binding Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

An input is **BPL-COMPLIANT** only if all are true:

1. **Single Semantic Frame**
   - The input does not mix:
     - fact and value,
     - decision and truth,
     - intent and execution.

2. **Declared Scope**
   - Temporal, protocol, and authority scope are explicit.
   - No implied scope expansion is allowed.

3. **No Implied Authority**
   - The input does not presume permission, legitimacy, or right to act.

4. **No Implicit Execution**
   - Language does not imply that action must follow.

5. **Resolvable Ambiguity**
   - If ambiguity exists, it is explicitly marked.
   - Hidden ambiguity is NON-COMPLIANT.

Failure of any rule blocks reasoning.

---

## 4. Effects of BPL Failure (CRITICAL)

If an input is NON-COMPLIANT under BPL:

- reasoning MUST NOT proceed,
- downstream protocols MUST NOT be invoked,
- no interpretation may be inferred,
- the system MUST return UNKNOWN or HALT.

BPL does not repair malformed inputs.  
It **refuses cognition**.

---

## 5. Relationship to Other Protocols

- **EVENT:** BPL does not open or close time.
- **IAM.MAI:** BPL does not legitimize irreversibility.
- **BNK:** BPL does not host presence.
- **KAPIA:** BPL does not record evidence.
- **PoP:** BPL does not create truth.
- **SPIRAL:** BPL does not write history.
- **ZIVai:** BPL does not regulate capacity.
- **22:** BPL does not narrate.
- **THIRD SPACE:** BPL determines whether a decision record may be formed.

BPL sits **before all of them**.

---

## 6. Failure Modes (EXPLICIT)

The following are **NON-COMPLIANT** under BPL:

- ambiguous prompts treated as intent,
- emotional urgency framed as necessity,
- questions that smuggle desired outcomes,
- language that collapses multiple protocol layers,
- identity inference through wording.

These MUST block reasoning.

---

## 7. Canonical One-Line Definition

BPL is the protocol that decides whether reasoning is allowed to begin.
