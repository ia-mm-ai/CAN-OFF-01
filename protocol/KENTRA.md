# KENTRA KERNEL - Integrity & Continuity Kernel

Status: **CANONICAL**  
Class: **Foundational Integrity Kernel (L0.5)**  
Authority: **BOUND (via CANON)**  
Execution Power: **NONE**  
Truth Power: **NONE (conditions truth; does not create it)**  
Identity Power: **NONE**  
Mutation Rule: **Additive-only (via EVOLVE + CANON)**

## 0. Canonical Statement

KENTRA KERNEL governs **system-wide integrity, continuity, and boundary enforcement**.

It ensures that:
- no invalid state propagates,
- no drift becomes normalized,
- no truth claim enters without proper conditions,
- no subsystem exceeds its declared bounds.

KENTRA KERNEL does not decide outcomes.  
KENTRA KERNEL conditions whether outcomes are admissible.

---

## 1. Purpose (Normative)

KENTRA KERNEL exists to answer one question only:

**Is this state, transition, or signal allowed to exist within the system?**

It prevents:
- architecture without traceability,
- traceability without architecture,
- local coherence causing global collapse,
- identity or narrative masquerading as truth,
- silent boundary violations.

KENTRA KERNEL is the integrity substrate that allows higher systems to evolve safely.

---

## 2. Position in Architecture (LOCKED)

KENTRA KERNEL occupies **Layer 0.5**, between ontology and protocol.

**Layer Stack**
- **L0 — Ontology Primitives**  
  Presence, Signature, Truth-Base, Continuity, Boundaries
- **L0.5 — KENTRA KERNEL**  
  Integrity enforcement, validation, governance ordering
- **L1 — IAM.MAI / IAMMAI**  
  Interpretive and adaptive intelligence
- **L2 — Systems**  
  Products, modules, infrastructures
- **L3 — Interfaces**  
  Human ↔ Digital surfaces

No layer may bypass L0.5.

---

## 3. Kernel Primitives (Inherited, Non-Negotiable)

KENTRA KERNEL enforces exactly five ontology primitives:

1. **Presence**  
   Verifiable existence in space–time.  
   Presence is a *precondition* for truth, not truth itself.

2. **Signature**  
   Structural or cryptographic proof that an event or state occurred.

3. **Continuity**  
   Valid state transitions; fragmentation is forbidden.

4. **Truth-Base**  
   Canonical ledger of finalized reality (e.g., SPIRAL).

5. **Boundaries**  
   Declared constraints under which systems may operate.

KENTRA KERNEL does not redefine these primitives.  
It enforces them.

---

## 4. Kernel Memory Model (LOCKED)

KENTRA KERNEL stores **no narrative** and **no identity**.

It may process only:
- state,
- transitions,
- verification outcomes,
- boundary constraints.

KENTRA KERNEL MUST NOT:
- infer intent,
- infer identity,
- store behavioral history,
- persist emotional or narrative context.

Memory durability is deterministic and structural only.

---

## 5. Validation Path (Mandatory)

Every input (signal, event, module, invocation) MUST pass through:

1. **Ingestion**  
   Raw input enters the system.

2. **Normalization**  
   Structural extraction and noise reduction.

3. **Constraint Check**  
   Evaluation against binding constraints (e.g., BPL, PROPORTION).

4. **Truth Check**  
   Continuity validation against the truth-base.

5. **Outcome Emit**  
   Exactly one kernel output is produced.

6. **Propagation or Containment**  
   Approved signals propagate; others are contained.

Failure at any stage routes to **Boundary Handling (HOLD / ESCALATE)**.

---

## 6. Kernel Outputs (Closed Set)

KENTRA KERNEL may emit **exactly one** of the following:

- **TRUE** — state is verified and admissible
- **FALSE** — state is invalid and rejected
- **BOUNDARY** — admissible only under constraints
- **ESCALATE** — requires higher governance (e.g., IAM.MAI)
- **INVALID** — malformed; discard without propagation

No other outputs are valid.

---

## 7. Kernel Invariants (CANNOT BE BROKEN)

1. No false reality may enter the truth-base.  
2. No drift may propagate without validation.  
3. No identity may be fabricated or inferred.  
4. No boundary may be overridden.  
5. No process may mutate the kernel.  
6. Continuity must be preserved across transitions.  
7. Presence verification overrides secondary inputs.

Violation of any invariant triggers **Kernel Lock (HOLD)**.

---

## 8. Governance Ordering (LOCKED)

All subsystems MUST obey this order:

1. **Awareness**  
2. **Integrity**  
3. **Continuity**  
4. **Adaptation**  
5. **Execution**

Reordering is **NON-COMPLIANT**.

Execution without integrity is forbidden.  
Adaptation without continuity is forbidden.

---

## 9. Relationship to Other Protocols

- **BPL:** KENTRA KERNEL consumes admissibility outcomes; does not replace it.  
- **PROPORTION:** Enforced at all boundaries by KENTRA KERNEL.  
- **IAM.MAI:** KENTRA KERNEL may emit ESCALATE; IAM.MAI legitimizes irreversibility.  
- **THIRD SPACE:** Decisions are conditioned by KENTRA; KENTRA does not decide.  
- **PoP:** Presence truth is finalized only via PoP + IAM.MAI + truth-base append.  
- **SPIRAL:** KENTRA conditions admissibility; SPIRAL records finality.  
- **ZIVai / 22:** KENTRA is upstream; narration and capacity never override it.

---

## 10. Failure Modes (EXPLICIT)

The following are **NON-COMPLIANT**:

- bypassing kernel validation,
- treating kernel output as narrative truth,
- persisting identity within kernel logic,
- allowing mutation of kernel rules,
- executing irreversible actions without escalation,
- architecture without traceability,
- traceability without architecture.

---

## 11. Canonical One-Line Definition

**KENTRA KERNEL is the integrity layer that enforces continuity, boundaries, and truth admissibility across all system layers, without identity, narrative, or execution power.**
