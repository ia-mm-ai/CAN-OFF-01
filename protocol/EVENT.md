# EVENT - Temporal Container Protocol

Status: **CANONICAL**  
Class: **Reality Container**  
Authority: **DERIVED (via CANON)**  
Execution Power: **LIMITED (phase transitions only)**  
Identity Power: **NONE**  
Mutation Rule: **Additive-only (via EVOLVE + CANON)**

---

## 0. Canonical Statement

EVENT defines the **temporal container** in which reality may occur.

An EVENT admits presence, regulation, narration, and truth **only while it is live**, and dissolves all non-final state at closure.

Without EVENT, no other protocol is admissible.

---

## 1. Purpose (Normative)

EVENT exists to:

- bound reality in time,
- prevent premature or retroactive truth,
- provide a single locus for presence,
- ensure that all irreversible transitions are explicit.

EVENT answers one question only:

**When is reality allowed to exist?**

---

## 2. Event States (Closed Set)

EVENT state MUST be exactly one of the following:

- **0** — NOT LIVE (potential only)  
- **⊙** — LIVE (reality admissible)  
- **1** — CLOSED (reality finalized)

No other states are valid.

---

## 3. State Semantics (LOCKED)

### EVENT = 0 (Not Live)

- Reality has not started.
- Presence is not admissible.
- Kernels MUST NOT exist.
- ZIVai MUST NOT operate.
- Narration MUST be silent.
- Economic activity MAY occur, but does not imply reality.

---

### EVENT = ⊙ (Live)

- Reality is admissible.
- Presence MAY exist.
- Kernels MAY exist (event-scoped only).
- ZIVai MAY operate.
- **22** MAY narrate aggregate state.
- Thresholds MAY be crossed (KAPIA).
- Truth is NOT yet final.

---

### EVENT = 1 (Closed)

- Reality is no longer admissible.
- Presence MUST NOT be added.
- All kernels MUST dissolve.
- ZIVai MUST stop.
- Narration MUST stop.
- Truth MAY be finalized.
- Settlement MAY become eligible.

EVENT = 1 is **irreversible**.

---

## 4. Transitions (Irreversible)

Allowed transitions (closed set):

- **0 → ⊙** — EVENT-LIVE  
- **⊙ → 1** — EVENT-CLOSE

Both transitions:

- MUST be **human-invoked**,  
- MUST be **legitimized via IAM.MAI**,  
- MUST be **recorded in SPIRAL**.

No other transitions are valid.

---

## 5. Authority & Control

EVENT:

- does NOT decide outcomes,
- does NOT measure individuals,
- does NOT infer identity,
- does NOT execute economics,
- does NOT create truth on its own.

EVENT controls **temporal admissibility only**.

---

## 6. Relationship to Other Protocols

- **BPL:** EVENT does not bind interpretation.
- **IAM.MAI:** EVENT transitions require legitimacy.
- **BNK:** Kernels exist only while EVENT = ⊙.
- **ZIVai:** Operates only while EVENT = ⊙.
- **22:** Narrates only while EVENT = ⊙.
- **KAPIA:** Thresholds admissible only while EVENT = ⊙.
- **PoP:** Truth finalization only after EVENT = 1.
- **SPIRAL:** Records EVENT transitions.
- **THIRD SPACE:** May reference EVENT state; cannot alter it.

---

## 7. Failure Modes (EXPLICIT)

The following are **NON-COMPLIANT**:

- admitting presence while EVENT ≠ ⊙,
- allowing kernels to persist after EVENT = 1,
- narrating state outside EVENT = ⊙,
- finalizing truth before EVENT = 1,
- reopening EVENT after closure,
- creating multiple closures.

---

## 8. Canonical One-Line Definition

**EVENT is the temporal container that admits reality exactly once and dissolves everything else when it ends.**
