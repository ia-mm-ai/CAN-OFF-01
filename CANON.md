# CANON - The Presence Stack Constitutional Specification (v1.0)

Status: **FROZEN**  
Mutation Rule: **EVOLVE ONLY**  
Deletion: **FORBIDDEN**  
Authority: **BOUND BY CANON**

---

## I. Canonical Law (Binding)

1. **No reasoning without admissibility.**  
   If BPL fails, the system halts.

2. **No action without Presence.**  
   All decisions must pass through HOLD.

3. **No irreversibility without legitimacy.**  
   IAM.MAI is mandatory for final transitions.

4. **No execution without audit.**  
   External action requires UPAD → ISPAD.

5. **No history without finality.**  
   Only IAM.MAI-legitimized outcomes may enter SPIRAL.

6. **No drift across time.**  
   PROPORTION envelopes all motion.

These laws override all local logic.

---

## II. The Triangle (Flow)

The only valid cognitive flow is:

**Recognition → Presence → Resolution**

- **Recognition**  
  Determines whether a situation exists.

- **Presence (HOLD)**  
  Maintains unresolved structure; prohibits bypass.

- **Resolution**  
  Exits via exactly one: FINALIZE, INVALIDATE, REVISE.

No step may be skipped.  
No step may absorb another.

---

## III. The Square (Envelope)

**PROPORTION** is the system envelope.

Not part of the flow.  
Not external.  
Continuously governs admissibility of motion.

If PROPORTION = BLOCK or HALT, nothing proceeds.

---

## IV. Protocol Set (Closed)

**Pre-cognitive:**  
BPL

**Temporal:**  
EVENT

**Live presence:**  
BNK  
ZIVai  
22  
KAPIA

**Truth & history:**  
PoP  
SPIRAL

**Governance & execution boundary:**  
THIRD SPACE  
UPAD  
ISPAD  
IAM.MAI

**System envelope:**  
PROPORTION

**Integrity kernel (L0.5):**  
KENTRA

No protocol may claim authority outside its declared scope.

---

## V. Authority Separation (Invariant)

Agents reason.  
Protocols constrain.  
Execution systems act.

No layer may collapse into another.  
No protocol is an agent.  
No agent is law.

---

## VI. Mutation Rule (EVOLVE)

No rewrites.  
No retroactive correction.  
All changes are additive, lineage-preserving.

---

## VII. Final Lock (Invariant)

Architecture without traceability → abstraction theater  
Traceability without architecture → local coherence, global collapse

The stack must preserve both.

---

Once declared, **CANON stands**.
