# CANON - The Presence Stack Constitutional Specification (v1.0)

Status: **FROZEN**  
Mutation Rule: **EVOLVE ONLY**  
Deletion: **FORBIDDEN**  
Authority: **BOUND BY CANON**

## Canonical Notice

This file is the **root-level mirror** of `protocol/CANON.md`.

It exists for:
- immediate visibility,
- constitutional anchoring,
- repository-level clarity.

In the event of discrepancy:
> **`protocol/CANON.md` is the source of truth.**

Both documents MUST remain identical in substance.

## I. Canonical Law (Binding)

1. **No reasoning without admissibility.**  
   If BPL fails, the system halts.

2. **No action without Presence.**  
   All decisions must pass through HOLD.

3. **No irreversibility without legitimacy.**  
   IAM.MAI is mandatory for final transitions.

4. **No execution without audit.**  
   All external action requires UPAD → ISPAD.

5. **No history without finality.**  
   Only IAM.MAI-legitimized facts may enter SPIRAL.

6. **No drift across time.**  
   PROPORTION envelopes all motion.

These laws override all local logic.

---

## II. The Triangle (Flow)

The system’s only valid cognitive flow is:

**Recognition → Presence → Resolution**

- **Recognition**  
  Determines whether a situation exists.

- **Presence (HOLD)**  
  Maintains unresolved structure via reversible containment.

- **Resolution**  
  Selects exactly one exit:
  - FINALIZE
  - INVALIDATE
  - REVISE

No step may be skipped.  
No step may absorb another.

---

## III. The Square (Envelope)

**PROPORTION** is the continuity envelope.

- It is not part of the flow.
- It is not external.
- It continuously governs admissibility of motion.

If PROPORTION = BLOCK or HALT, nothing proceeds.

## IV. Canonical Protocol Set (Closed)

### Pre-Cognitive
- **BPL** — Binding Precondition Layer  
  (`protocol/BPL.md`)

### Temporal
- **EVENT** — Temporal Container  
  (`protocol/EVENT.md`)

### Live Presence
- **BNK** — Presence Custody  
  (`protocol/BNK.md`)
- **ZIVai** — Field Capacity Regulator  
  (`protocol/ZIVai.md`)
- **22** — Field Narration  
  (`protocol/22.md`)
- **KAPIA** — Threshold Crossing Evidence  
  (`protocol/KAPIA.md`)

### Truth & History
- **PoP** — Proof of Presence  
  (`protocol/PoP.md`)
- **SPIRAL** — Immutable History  
  (`protocol/SPIRAL.md`)

### Governance & Action
- **THIRD SPACE** — Decision Trace  
  (`protocol/THIRD-SPACE.md`)
- **UPAD** — Execution Request Boundary  
  (`protocol/UPAD.md`)
- **ISPAD** — Execution Legitimacy & Audit  
  (`protocol/ISPAD.md`)
- **IAM.MAI** — Irreversibility Legitimacy  
  (`protocol/IAM.MAI.md`)

### System Envelope
- **PROPORTION** — Continuity Constraint  
  (`protocol/PROPORTION.md`)

### Integrity Kernel (L0.5)
- **KENTRA** — Integrity & Continuity Kernel  
  (`protocol/KENTRA.md`)

No protocol may claim authority outside its declared scope.

---

## V. Authority Separation (Invariant)

- Agents reason.  
- Protocols constrain.  
- Execution systems act.

No layer may collapse into another.  
No protocol is an agent.  
No agent is law.

---

## VI. Time Semantics (Locked)

- Time does not pause for decisions.
- Execution defaults to **ASYNC**.
- Resolution does not imply immediacy.
- Reality continues unless explicitly finalized.

This preserves the invariant: **“time marches on.”**

---

## VII. Mutation Rule (EVOLVE)

- No edits.
- No rewrites.
- No retroactive correction.

All changes must:
- reference prior state,
- append forward,
- preserve lineage.

History is compost, not garbage.

---

## VIII. Final Binding Statement

This system chooses:
- continuity over control,
- legitimacy over speed,
- presence over force.

Once declared, **CANON stands**.
