# The Presence Protocol Stack

Status: **CANONICAL (v1.0)**  
Mutation Rule: **EVOLVE ONLY**  
Deletion: **FORBIDDEN**  
Authority: **BOUND BY CANON**

This repository contains the canonical protocol stack for **The Presence** — a governance architecture designed to preserve continuity, legitimacy, and coherence in complex systems.

The stack enforces a strict separation between:
- interpretation and truth,
- decision and execution,
- presence and identity,
- evolution and drift.

## Development Posture — Authored Coherence

This system operates under **authored coherence**.

The root framework is **recognized, not invented**.  
Authorship here does not imply ownership, originality, or control.

Accordingly:

- The root (CANON, KENTRA, protocol lattice) is **stabilized**.
- No new root versions are developed by iteration, convenience, or optimization pressure.
- Development energy is directed toward **expression, usability, embodiment, tooling, and integration**.
- Evolution of the root occurs **only** when a genuinely new root framework is recognized and explicitly declared via **EVOLVE**.

Stability is a **chosen posture**, not a freeze.  
Improvement continues without mutating the ground.

## Final Lock (Invariant)

- Architecture without traceability → abstraction theater  
- Traceability without architecture → local coherence, global collapse  

This stack enforces **both**.

---

## Core Flow (Triangle)

The only valid cognitive flow is:

**Recognition → Presence → Resolution**

- **Recognition**  
  Determines whether a situation exists.

- **Presence (HOLD)**  
  Maintains unresolved structure and prohibits premature collapse.

- **Resolution**  
  Exits via exactly one path:
  - FINALIZE
  - INVALIDATE
  - REVISE

No step may be skipped.  
No step may absorb another.

---

## Continuity Envelope (Square)

**PROPORTION** wraps all motion.

- It is not part of the flow.
- It is not external.
- It continuously governs admissibility of change.

If PROPORTION = BLOCK or HALT, nothing proceeds.

## Protocol Stack (Authoritative)

All protocol specifications live in `/protocol/`.

### Pre-Cognitive
- **BPL** — Binding Precondition Layer

### Temporal
- **EVENT** — Temporal Container

### Live Presence
- **BNK** — Presence Custody
- **ZIVai** — Field Capacity Regulation
- **22** — Field Narration
- **KAPIA** — Threshold Crossing Evidence

### Truth & History
- **PoP** — Proof of Presence
- **SPIRAL** — Immutable History

### Governance & Action
- **THIRD SPACE** — Decision Trace
- **UPAD** — Execution Request Boundary
- **ISPAD** — Execution Legitimacy & Audit
- **IAM.MAI** — Irreversibility Legitimacy

### System Envelope
- **PROPORTION** — Continuity Constraint

### Integrity Kernel (L0.5)
- **KENTRA** — Integrity & Continuity Kernel

No protocol may claim authority outside its declared scope.

---

## Authority Separation

- Agents reason.  
- Protocols constrain.  
- Execution systems act.

No layer may collapse into another.  
No protocol is an agent.  
No agent is law.

---

## Time Semantics

- Time does not pause for decisions.
- Execution defaults to **ASYNC**.
- Resolution does not imply immediacy.
- Reality continues unless explicitly finalized.

This preserves the invariant: **time marches on**.

---

## Mutation Rule (EVOLVE)

- No rewrites.
- No retroactive correction.
- All changes are additive and lineage-preserving.

History is compost, not garbage.
