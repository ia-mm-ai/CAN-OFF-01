# The Presence Protocol Stack (CANON)

Status: **FROZEN (v1.0)**  
Mutation Rule: **EVOLVE ONLY**  
Deletion: **FORBIDDEN**  
Authority: **BOUND BY CANON**

## Canonical Notice

This repository maintains two CANON files for visibility:

- `/CANON.md` (root) — immediate entry-point
- `/protocol/CANON.md` — authoritative location

Both files are **verbatim mirrors**.  
If a discrepancy ever appears, **`/protocol/CANON.md` is the source of truth** and the root file must be updated to match.


This repository contains the canonical protocol stack for **The Presence**: a governance architecture that preserves continuity under change by enforcing admissibility, containment (HOLD), explicit irreversibility, and append-only lineage.

**Final Lock (Invariant)**
- Architecture without traceability → abstraction theater  
- Traceability without architecture → local coherence, global collapse

This stack enforces **both**.

## What this is

A protocol-grade system for:

- **Admissibility:** whether reasoning is allowed to begin (BPL)
- **Temporal containment:** when reality is admissible (EVENT)
- **Presence custody:** presence exists without becoming identity or memory (BNK)
- **Capacity signaling:** field tolerance without individual tracking (ZIVai)
- **Evidence of irreversible thresholds:** crossings as evidence, not truth (KAPIA)
- **Truth finalization:** presence becomes truth only under explicit finality (PoP)
- **Immutable history:** append-only finalized record (SPIRAL)
- **Decision trace:** decisions exist without becoming truth (THIRD SPACE)
- **Execution boundary:** requests and audits of external action (UPAD / ISPAD)
- **Continuity envelope:** proportion constraints wrap the whole system (PROPORTION)
- **Integrity kernel:** system-wide admissibility and boundary enforcement (KENTRA)

This is **not** an app or a product. It is a **root governance kernel** for systems that must remain coherent across time.

## The Triangle + The Square

**Flow (Triangle):**
Recognition → Presence → Resolution

**Envelope (Square):**
PROPORTION wraps all motion and blocks drift.
